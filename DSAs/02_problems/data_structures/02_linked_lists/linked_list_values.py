# Write a function, linked_list_values, that takes in the head of a linked list as an argument. The function should return a list containing all values of the nodes in the linked list.

# create instances of the Node class, with their corresponding values and assign them to variables:

# a = Node("a")
# b = Node("b")
# c = Node("c")
# d = Node("d")

# establish a link between the nodes using the "next" attribute:

# a.next = b
# b.next = c
# c.next = d
