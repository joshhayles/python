# DSAs
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

## The primary focus is Quality vs Quantity
- understading what the problem is asking and being able to articulate it
- slowing the problem down and revealing the necessary steps to solve it
- understanding what each line is doing
- diving deeper into the Python language to learn what it's capabilities are, its quirks, strengths and weaknesses
- interpreting the code to find out the Time and Space complexities
- I place a preference on the following (i.e. Quality of understanding vs the Number of problems solved)
  - high quality comprehension of the code that solves the problem
  - what the Python language is capable of
  - time and space complexities (Big O)
  - the technique of the Algorithms (so it can be applied to other problems)
